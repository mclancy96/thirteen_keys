# The Keys to the White House: Key Tracker

This program tracks the likelihood of the two major party candidates winning the United States' presidential election. It uses the Keys to the White House by Allan Lichtman, a guide to predicting the next American president.

## What are the Keys to the White House?
There are thirteen total keys as defined by Dr. Lichtman. They are statements about the incumbent candidate/party and challenger that are evaluated as being true or false. The incumbent candidate/party wants as few keys turned to false as possible, and the challenger wants as many keys turned to false as possible. If there are 6 keys or more turned to false, the challenger wins, and if there are 5 keys or less turned to false, the incumbent wins. 

## Thirteen Keys:
1. **Incumbent-party Mandate:** After the midterm elections, the incumbent party holds more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives than it did after the previous midterm elections.
2. **Nomination Contest:** There is no serious contest for the incumbent-party nomination.
3. **Incumbency:** The incumbent-party candidate is the sitting president.
4. **Third Party:** There is no significant third-party or independent campaign.
5. **Short-Term Economy:** The economy is not in recession during the election campaign.
6. **Long-Term Economy:** Real annual per-capita economic growth during the term equals or exceeds mean growth during the two previous terms.
7. **Policy Change:** The incumbent administration effects major changes in national policy.
8. **Social Unrest:** There is no sustained social unrest during the incumbent's term.
9. **Scandal:** The incumbent administation is untainted by major scandal.
10. **Foreign or military failure:** The incumbent administraiton suffers no major failure in foreign or military affairs.
11. **Foreign or military success:** The incumbent administraiton achieves a major success in foreign or military affairs.
12. **Incumbent Charisma:** The incumbent-party candidate is charismatic or a national hero.
13. **Challenger Charisma:** The challenging-party candidate is not charismatic or a national hero.

## Controversy with the Keys
Critics have claimed that some of the keys can be seen as subjective, such as whether a candidate is charismatic. For the sake of this project, I will be as objective as possible when turning keys. If you feel that a key should be turned when it isn't, you have the ability to turn the key yourself to see what the result would be with that key turned.
